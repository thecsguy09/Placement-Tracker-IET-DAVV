# IET DAVV Placement Tracker

## Tech Stack
- **ReactJS** (Vite)  
- **Redux**  
- **Tailwind CSS**  

## About This Project
This is a **small initiative** from my side to help my juniors access placement data easily.  
The goal is to provide them with a **useful resource** that can guide their preparation and decisions.  

## Contributing Guide
- If you want to work on an existing issue, **assign it to yourself** to avoid duplicate efforts.  
- Keep all discussions **within the issue thread** so everyone can track progress.  
- If you have an idea for a new feature, feel free to **create a new issue** and assign it to yourself if you plan to implement it.  

### Steps to Raise a Pull Request
1. **Do not work directly on the `main` or `dev` branch.** Always create a new branch.  
2. **Assign the issue/task** to yourself before starting work.  
3. Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b "<your-name>/dev/<feature-name>"
